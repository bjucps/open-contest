# OpenContest
OpenContest is an open-source programming contest management system written in Python. It allows judges to write problems and contest participants to submit solutions to those problems. 

## Quick Start

For example, to install docker on Ubuntu 18.04 execute the following:
```
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Logout, then login. Then, install the open-contest docker image:

```
$> docker pull bjucps/open-contest
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from bjucps/open-contest
Digest: sha256:9f65996f196f8780956cd08b9ed53d84f4e26c5e8456fe50c6487e8a5f316948
Status: Image is up to date for bjucps/open-contest:latest
```

Finally, start the contest server:

```
$> docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -v ~/db:/db -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 80:8000 bjucps/open-contest
INFO:root:saving Admin
INFO:root:Admin username is 'Admin'
INFO:root:Admin password is 'presently description kirk died'
INFO:root:Starting server...
```

## Installation
To run OpenContest,
1. Install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) on a Unix-based machine and start the daemon.
2. Run `docker pull bjucps/open-contest`
3. Create a directory to hold the contest database (ex. mkdir ~/db)
4. Run `docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -v [db-path]:/db -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 80:8000 bjucps/open-contest`, substituting the contest database location for `[db-path]`.
5. Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and enter `Admin` as the username and enter the password generated by OpenContest (visible in the command prompt)
6. Create problems, a contest to hold them, and users to participate


## Detailed Usage
OpenContest runs inside a Docker container and starts other containers on the host machine to run submissions. The explanation for the Docker flags used above is shown below:
```bash
docker run
    -v /tmp:/tmp # Maps the /tmp directory on the Docker image to the /tmp directory on the real machine
                 # This is needed for running the submitted code, since submissions are processed
                 # in the /tmp directory.
    -v /<db-path>:/db # Maps the path that you want to hold the database on the physical machine
                      # to the /db directory on the container.
                      # Allows the database to persist between runs of the container.
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Maps the Docker daemon socket to the image,
                                                 # allowing OpenContest to run submissions
                                                 # in Docker containers.
    -p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000/tcp # Maps port 8000 inside the container to port 8000 outside the container.
                             # You can change the IP so that OpenContest listens only on a particular
                             # network interface, and you can also change the port 
                             # on which OpenContest listens.
    bjucps/open-contest # DockerHub address of the production version
    "<Yourname>" # The name of the first admin user. This user will be given admin rights,
                 # and a password will be generated and printed at the beginning of the log.
    8000 # Port number inside the container.
```

## Contest Information
OpenContest allows you to create multiple contests that run at different times. The most common use case for this feature is to allow for a practice round before an actual contest. To create a contest, go to Setup > Contest > Create Contest and enter the contest details.

After creating the contest, you can choose problems to go into the contest.

Before the contest begins, the home page will show a countdown to the beginning of the contest.

During the contest, the home page will show a list of problems in the contest.

## How To Print a Problem
OpenContest formats problems for printing so that you can print and distribute problem statement packets to contestants. To print a problem, go to the edit page for the problem, click *View Problem*, and print the page with Ctrl+P.

## How To Print the User Login Information
From the user list page, you can print the page with Ctrl+P for a list of usernames and passwords. You can then cut the paper and deliver these sheets to the contestants.
